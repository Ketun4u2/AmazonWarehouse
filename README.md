Based on Bridge Desgin Pattern.
Also, we can include the Interpreter Pattern.
Not sure what it does, but apparently its got to do with using Java Reflection, which we will probably implement.

Progress:
Bridge Implementation is depenedent on Java Reflection.   								  - K9  
The Employee, Customer, Admin classes need working on.    								  - K2N
The Time is broken. Java has too many import problems.   								    - K9
Storing and Reading the Order details from file needs implementation.       - K2N
All the orders need to be stored in an arraylist held by the Admin class.   - K2N
JUnit Test Cases (Done Last Preferably) 																		- K2N
