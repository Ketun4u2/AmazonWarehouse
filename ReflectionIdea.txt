//This is all an assumption. Not sure whats actually happening

//This would determine which class we are dealing with based on user input String name
Class c = Class.forName(name);

//This makes a placeholder constructor based on the class (determined earlier)
//It includes the potential parameters in the brackets, of course we shall change these
Constructor ctor = c.getConstructor(Integer.class, Integer.class);

//This is just sample code. Doesn't mean too much. For Testing purposes
Integer param1 = hm.get("xPos") ...;
Integer param2 = hm.get("yPos") ...;

//This actually instantiates the object. 
Object instanceOfTheClass = ctor.newInstance(param1, param2);
//The "Object" can probably be changed
